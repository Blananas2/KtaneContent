                        In 1802, the merchant ship Obra Dinn set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                        Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As chief insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, you have been dispatched immediately to Falmouth, found means to board the ship, and are to prepare an assessment of damages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To sign off on the final insurance document for submission, the final three souls must be identified. Do this by successfully filling out the correct Name, Cause of Death, and a Culprit (if there is one) for the given Audio that corresponds to the correct crew log.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Crew Logs, separations in the quotes indicate a different person talking. An "X" indicates that the line of dialog for that log was spoken by the deceased.
