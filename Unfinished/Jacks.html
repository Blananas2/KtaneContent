					<h2>On the Subject of Jacks</h2>
					<p class="flavour-text">No spades, no trades, and no Jills, just you and your bouncy ball.</p>

					<p>A number between 1 and 5 will be displayed on the screen. This number refers to how many jacks need to be picked at once in one round. Press the button labelled "toss" to throw out some jacks into random positions. Then press the button labelled "start" to start the round of jacks. Once the toss button has been pressed, the sound of a small rubber ball hitting the ground can be heard periodically. In the time between bounces, pick up jacks based on the number displayed. For example, if the screen displays a 3, pick up 3 jacks between every bounce untill all jacks are cleared. If there are less than the displayed number of jacks left, picking up all of them will disarm the module. Note that jacks must be first tossed for the start button to be functional.</p>
