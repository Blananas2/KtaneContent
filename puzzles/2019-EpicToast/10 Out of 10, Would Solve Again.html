        <h1>10/10, Would Solve Again</h1>
		<p class="flavour-text">At first, these modules got lots of stars (both figuratively and literally), but what difference does that make?</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Crappiest module I’ve ever defused.</p>
		<p>All the information is given to you at once and it’s just a disaster.</p>
		<p>Really didn’t have to be on a timer either.</p>
		<p>I’d recommend this for caffeine lovers and people who enjoy suffering.</p>
		<p>No sane person would play this.</p>
		<p>A three out of ten for me, however, because it has some cool voice lines that make it at least a little better. ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>A multi-stage copy of an already-existing module.</p>
		<p>Randomly came back from the dead after it got taken down?</p>
		<p>I’m not entirely sure what happened. </p>
		<p>Even then, it’s a good looking module with a not-so-unique idea.</p>
		<p>So good job to TheRealWitch and whoever remade this, I guess. ★★★★★★★★★☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Oh, another Perky mod.</p>
		<p>Really interesting concept this time around.</p>
		<p>I use the cheatsheet, however, which makes it pretty trivial.</p>
		<p>Of course, it’s your choice if you really want to analyze frequencies or whatever the terms are.</p>
		<p>Not bad. ★★★★★★★★☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Don’t think this module needs three stages, it already takes long enough to figure out where you are.</p>
		<p>Risky module to enable on your profile, because as said previously, it takes forever.</p>
		<p>Although some people have their methods for doing it quicker.</p>
		<p>Cool concept, good job EpicToast.</p>
		<p>Overall an interesting module, but rather time-consuming. ★★★★★★★☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Great module in terms of being kind of funny, but it’s reaaally boring to solve. </p>
		<p>Edgework conditions are gross.</p>
		<p>Modules by Royal_Flu$h tend to be like that, I suppose.</p>
		<p>It does look really good, as always, however. </p>
		<p>Not happy that the forename and surname determining uses the same format. </p>
		<p>It’s a two out of ten for me. ★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Color mixing, weird bases, overly complicated math, this mod’s got it all. </p>
		<p>Easy, quick and fun-- in comparison to other SpeakingEvil modules, that is. </p>
		<p>Too long to solve to be used in normal play. </p>
		<p>Understandable, considering its creator. </p>
		<p>Sadly has a sequel. ★★★★★★★☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Very old module I’m reviewing today. </p>
		<p>It’s the first of a series of modules (although only a short three-mod one). </p>
		<p>Recommended for people with experience with music symbols and playing an instrument, although it’s fun to try to play with a non-musician. </p>
		<p>Glad it has a chart to help (on the second page). </p>
		<p>Oddly enough, it’s missing page numbers…? ★★★★★★★☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Lazy needy, barely interesting, although it does have a “quirk” to it. </p>
		<p>You might use this if you don’t want any challenge. </p>
		<p>Rest assured, you don’t HAVE to listen to its manual (especially if you’re not old enough!) </p>
		<p>A generally lame mod. ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Hate this one, it’s really annoying (hehe). </p>
		<p>You actually have to check it every ten seconds, with no indication other than the visual. </p>
		<p>Didn’t have to be a solvable, could’ve passed fine as a needy. </p>
		<p>Really, dude? </p>
		<p>A ten-second-timer-psuedo-needy-boss?! ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</p>
		<hr>
		<p>A really simple solvable, in the same vein as Digital Root, based on a simple math operation that you can find in a lot of manuals nowadays. </p>
		<p>Really not that interesting, and sometimes it’s difficult to solo.</p>
		<p>A decent-looking module nonetheless, thanks Royal_Flu$h. ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</p>
