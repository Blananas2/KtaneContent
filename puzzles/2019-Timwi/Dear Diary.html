            <li>Dear diary, I hear many people are eating cheesecake today. Just like some eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. It’s almost like it’s legally required now?</li>
            <li>Dear diary, if you don’t like the idea of being poisoned, today is the day to feast in recognition of your patron Saint.</li>

            <li>Dear diary, why do people celebrate the anniversary of a battle in 1460 today? They say they celebrate the end of it, but it only lasted this one day!</li>
