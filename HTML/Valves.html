						<ul>
							<li>There are 3 valves on the module.
							<li>To solve the module, sumbit the correct valve combination.
							<li>To find the correct valve combination, go to the starting valve position by going to the sum of the serial number's position on the table in reading order.
							<li>If the sum of the serial number is 0, then the correct answer is ⚫⚪⚫.
							<li>Move, in reading order, the amount of the 1st character of the serial number. Make sure you move the last digit of any number over 9. (A = 1, B = 2, etc.)
							<li>However, if the character was originally a number, move in backwards reading order instead. Wrap around to the beginning or end of the table when needed.
							<li>If none of the valves is in the same position and status (pushed in or out) as the current combination, then move one space until at least 1 valve is.
							<li>If exactly 1 of the valves is in the same position and status as the current combination, invert that valve by pushing in or pulling out the valve.
							<li>Otherwise, If exactly 2 of the valves are in the same position and status as the current combination, invert the other valve by pushing in or pulling out the valve.
							<li>Otherwise, If all of the valves are in the same position and status as the current combination, this is the correct combination.
							<li>Repeat these steps with all of the serial number digits, using the new combination as the current combination.
							<li>Once all the serial number characters has been done, then the correct combination is the current one.
							<li>The module will submit its state 5 seconds after any valve is pushed down. If the valve on the top is black, then the answer for that valve is the opposite of what it is supposed to be. If the material for the valves is silver, then answer all of the valves the opposite of what it should be. (Black and silver will cancel each other out.)
 							<li>A shaded circle in the table represents a pushed down valve, and an open circle is up.
