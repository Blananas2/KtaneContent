						<ul>
							<li>There are 3 valves on the module that can be pushed or pulled.
							<li>Find the starting valve position by going to the sum of the serial number digits' position on the table in reading order starting from 1.
							<li>If the sum of the serial number is 0, then the correct answer is ⚫⚪⚫.**
							<li>Move, in reading order, the amount of the 1st character of the serial number where A = 1 (make sure you modulo 10). Move in backwards reading order if it was originally a number.
							<li>Compare the starting combination with the one you landed on. Find the amount of matches for each valve position. A match is both shaded, or both unshaded.
							<li>If there are no matches, move one more space in same direction until there is one.
							<li>If there is 1 match, invert that valve position in the starting valve combination by making it shaded or unshaded.
							<li>Otherwise, if there is 2 matches, then invert the unmaching valve in the starting valve combination.
							<li>Otherwise, If all of valves match, then ignore the rest of the serial number; this is the correct combination.**
							<li>Repeat these steps with all of the serial number digits, using the edited combination as the starting combination.
							<li>Once all the serial number characters has been done, then the correct combination is the current one.**
							<li>The module will submit it state 3 seconds after any valve is pushed down. 
 							<li>A shaded circle in the table represents a pushed down valve, and an open circle is up.
							<li>**However, if the valves are silver, then invert the whole solution. If the valve's color on the top is black, invert that valve's solution. This means that silver and black will cancel each other out.
