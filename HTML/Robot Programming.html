                    <h2>On the Subject of Robot Programming</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Every kids fantasy job is now your adult nightmare. Just try not to ‘crash’ the program.</p>
                    
					<p>This module has 4 directional arrows, and big and small display, and a maze. The small display will show 2 numbers. The left number determines the top 6 rows, the other the bottom 3 rows. Your task as the expert is to determine which behavior each robot has. This is done using the tree of options below.</p>
					<p>The names of the robots are assigned left to right from the defuser’s perspective, starting with the top of the list of names down to the bottom of the list.</p>

                    <p>R.O.B will follow your commands perfectly.</p>
					<p>HAL will do the complete opposite of your commands.</p>
					<p>R2D2 will alternate between the personalita of R.O.B and HAL, starting with R.O.B.</p>
					<p>Fender will move according to the serial number. Fender will look at the next position of the serial number after each command he gets. If he was looking at a digit last, he will act like R.O.B. If he was looking at a letter last, he will act like HAL.</p>
					<p>Now that you’ve determined which robot is which, now you can begin inputting commands. Before you do this, however, there are a few things you must keep track of.</p>
					<p>There is an LED that will change every time you input a command. This LED will be the color one of the robots. When you input the command, the command will be sent to the robot that is the color of the LED. The LED goes in a pattern. Blue, Lime, Red, and Yellow. If the robot that the LED controls can’t move, then it will go to the next color in the pattern. When a robot reaches their respective goal, the robot will deactivate and the color of the robot will no longer show in the pattern.</p>
					<p>Once a button is pressed, the robot will move accordingly. If a robot runs into a wall or another robot, the module will strike.</p>
					<p>Upon a strike, the robot in which crashed will return to the square it was in before the crash, but no robot’s coordinates will be reset. The small display will show the reason of the crash (OOB means “Out of Boundaries”.), afterwards showing the colors of the robots in reading order, as if they were in their starting position. The position of the serial number Fender was on before the crash occurred will also show, along with how Fender will act when he is next activated. If Fender or R2D2 crashed, they will act how they acted before the crash.</p>
