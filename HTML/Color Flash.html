                It's easy to identify colors. Red, Blue, Green, etc. Turns out it's a bit harder when you display a word color in a different color though...

			<ul>
                <li class="translatable">A color flash module will repeatedly flash a sequence of 8 different words representing colors in different colors.</li>
                <li class="translatable">The possible colors are Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Magenta and White.</li>
                <li class="translatable">There is also a Yes button and a No button on the module.</li>
                <li class="translatable">Only <em>one</em> of the Yes and No buttons need to be pressed to disarm the module, but must be pressed at the correct time according to the rules below.</li>
                <li class="translatable">The color of the last word in the sequence determines which set of rules to follow below.</li>
                <li class="translatable">Follow the rules down from the top-most rule, down to the bottom-most rule for the block that applies to your module.</li>
