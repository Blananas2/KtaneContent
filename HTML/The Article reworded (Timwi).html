                <h2>On the Subject of The Article</h2>

                <p class="flavour-text">This module isn’t not easy.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>10 (ten) colors will flash in a sequence. There is a brief pause between repetitions of the sequence.</li>
                    <li>If green occurs 5 (five) or more times, press 1.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if cyan occurs 4 (four) or more times, press 2.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, press 3.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Clarifications</h3>
                <ul class='clarifications'>
                    <li>Once you know what the correct button is, it can be pressed at any time.</li>
                    <li>Pressing a wrong button will incur a strike, but not modify the sequence or the solution.</li>
                    <li>Only follow the instructions for the first condition that applies. The word “otherwise” indicates that the instruction following it is only to be followed if the previous condition did not hold.</li>
                    <li>If there are several copies of this module on the same bomb, they may have different flashing color sequences and therefore different solutions. You must follow the instructions <em>separately</em> for each copy of the module.</li>
                    <li>The 10 (ten) colors flash repeatedly in the <em>same</em> order. The sequence of flashing colors does not change between repetitions.</li>
                    <li>There are two LEDs that flash the colors. One is above the buttons, the other below them.</li>
                    <li>Both of the LEDs (the one above the buttons and the one below the buttons) always show the same color. This means you can safely ignore one of them.</li>
                    <li>“Green” is the color similar to the color of leaves (that is, leaves on trees, except in autumn, when they’re brown).</li>
                    <li>“Cyan” is a color that is similar to turquoise, or sky blue (light blue like the sky). You may have noticed ink of this color in your inkjet printer, alongside yellow, magenta (pinkish) and black.</li>
                    <li>Other colors may occur within the sequence. Do not count those.</li>
                    <li>“Press 1” means the press the button whose label consists of the digit 1 (one). On this module, that button is on the left.</li>
                    <li>“Press 2” means the press the button whose label consists of the digit 2 (two). On this module, that button is in the middle.</li>
                    <li>“Press 3” means the press the button whose label consists of the digit 3 (three). On this module, that button is on the right.</li>
                    <li>“5 or more times” includes 5 times, 6 times, 7 times, etc. Note that “exactly 5 times” is included, as is any number greater than 5. Conversely, if the relevant color occurs only 4 times, only 3 times, or any smaller number of times (or not at all), that rule does not hold.</li>
                    <li>“4 or more times” includes 4 times, 5 times, 6 times, etc. Again, “exactly 4 times” is included, as is any number greater than 4, but 3 or fewer times is not.</li>
                    <li>The colors need not flash consecutively. “5 or more times” means anywhere in the sequence. Other colors may flash in between.</li>
                    <li>Only count the colors within a single iteration of the sequence. If a color occurs 3 times within the sequence, and then another 3 times because the sequence repeats, this does <em>not</em> count as 6 times.</li>
                    <li>This module does not require any edgework (batteries, indicators, ports or the serial number).</li>
